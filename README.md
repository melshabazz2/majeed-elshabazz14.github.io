Use Case 1 — Description
Prompt
…I had minor issues with my css that were due to attention to detail, for example. I had a problem changing the colors on my navigation link and all my buttons and I gave my css to ai and asked to help me figure out how to fix it.
Response
…The problem was that I tried to use root to define some variables specifically for the elements in my navigation container and the buttons used throughout the page but didn't realize that in the containers I failed to use the variables that I defined in my root and was overwriting what I had placed in the blocks of my html. I also didn’t write the variables in my root properly. Some were missing dishes and some didn't have them in the correct spaces. AI corrected me and showed me how to properly structure my root in order to get the results that I am looking for.
Also root is used to define variables that I would like to use globally in my css, 
What I changed and why
…. What I changed were the mistakes that I made in order to produce the outcome I was looking for.
How it works
…So what I was fixing was the color that's displayed when you hover over my navigation links. As you hover over each link it changes the text color to orange to show that you are hovering over this specific link.

Use Case 2 — Description
Prompt
… I was inspired by a rotating 3d logo on my cousin's brand page and attempted to recreate my own version for my website. I asked chat gpt to help me design my own logo, gave them a reference photo and what I wanted to change to make it my own and to show me how to write it out in my css. 
What I changed and why
…. AI gave me a logo that was far off from what I had imagined, so instead I asked to just simply recreate the logo with my edits and instead if it being a 3d logo that rotates just make it a regular image that I can crop out and add to my page. AI produced exactly what I wanted
How it works
… There is no function to it, it’s just a fancy quick logo that I was interested in bringing to life for a more appealing look on my website.

Use Case 3 — Description
Prompt
…I have done some basic designing and wanted to use AI to add a little more style. originally my nav links would just display a white line under when you hovered over it but AI introduced me to using transition.
Response
…Ai suggested using transition on my nav links for better guidance through the links by allowing the edit to show what is happening rather than just flashing before your eyes can see

 transition allowed me to change the animation of the hover on my links, instead of a line displaying under each link when you hover over it, transition allows me to produce a new animation that flashes orange from the beginning of the link im hovering over it to the end of it, basically from start to finish, in order to produce a more smoother and appealing look for the nav buttons.
What I changed and why
….Being that I am new to transition I didn’t dive deeper into it to see multiple ways for it to work so I left it like how AI suggested. 
How it works
…Transition works from start to finish, lIke a loading bar in a video game. In order for it to work you first must assign a hover to your link or whatever element you choose to add this property onto, next you give it a time speed (linear or constant) which is decided by preference and lastly you add a background color of your choice.
